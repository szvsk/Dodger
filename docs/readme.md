# Dodger

Bad guys falling from the top of the screen. You should avoid them as long as possible!

**Note about current state of game**

This is project I took for learning how to use GameMaker Studio 2. When I published this thing on Github I thought that I done with it, but now I realise that shouldn't share a thing in that sad state.

I will fix and improve this game some time in future, but it still will be a very simple game, as I will not change gameplay drastically.
